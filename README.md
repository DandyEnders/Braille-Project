# Introduction
Purpose of this document is to track our progress on our project.

# Notes to Group Members
- Initially, we were given no requirements, no restrictions, or no useful informations regarding the braille program itself. To construct a successful product, we must conduct researches. 
- This document will be updated constantly.
- Please note that our professor ( customer ) could intentionally tell ambiguous things, so if anything is ambiguous, we must clarify its ambiguity by asking him thoroughly.
- If a topic is a lengthy one to put, please either create a separate google doc and link the document to this document or link directly.  [And here is the instruction how to link your document to this document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DfhXRIQdrxzRiRgt-cYo2Zj-vKfTUzwrMwbMpkG6Hac/edit?usp=sharing)
- Contact infos for our professor are on [this link](https://wiki.eecs.yorku.ca/course_archive/2017-18/W/2311/contact).

# Questions
The “Questions” section is for us to write down any questions that we do now know the answer to. If one writes down the question, others might be able to answer. 

Leave answer blank if you can’t figure it out. Others might figure it out.

Add extra rows by dragging the table -> right click -> add x rows below.

| Questions | Answers |
| ---       |  ---     |
|Once we figure out the requirements, what are we going to design first ? The GUI? |Design of GUI can be asked to professor, and we will set up to do lists things we need to complete. Do the GUI first if it is on the todo list. | 
|Do we have an API for this project or are we supposed to make one?| We have to make one. And [here is how to make javadoc page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx-8BD_Osdw)|
|What is a screen reader?| |
|Is there a specific genre of scenarios that we must consider? Literature? History? Math? Science? What type of scenarios do the educators want to create?| |
|For what age group will this app be used for?|Educator is using the app to write scenarios for the kids.|
|When the user saves the scenario, do they have flexibility to which kind of file they save it to? (ex. “.mp3” ?).| Scenario files are text file, more like a script file to run on the given braille program. Sound files such as .mp3 are imported on separate files that scenario mentioned in the scenario file.|
# Researches
The “researches” section is for us to write down collection of information related to braille.

Please write down any significant information ( such as how braille works, why are they used, who uses it, how it is used by them) that you found. Also, it would be great if we summarize the information you found for others to know.

Researches can be done through asking the customer ( professor ), searching internet, and possibly, asking a real person - who could be an expert on Braille.

1. [What is Braille?](http://www.afb.org/info/living-with-vision-loss/braille/what-is-braille/123) - “Braille is a system of raised dots that can be read with the fingers by people who are blind or who have low vision … Braille is not a language. Rather, it is a code by which many languages—such as English, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, and dozens of others—may be written and read.”
2. Capital letters are indicated by placing a dot 6 in front of the letter to be capitalized. Two capital signs mean the whole word is capitalized.
3. Punctuation: A “period” is represented with dots 2, 5, and 6. An “exclamation point” is with 2, 3, 5. The “comma” in braille is dot 2, and is used in numbers and with words.
4. [Braille Numbers](http://braillebug.afb.org/braille_deciphering.asp): made using the first ten letters of the alphabet, "a" through "j", and a special number sign, dots 3, 4, 5, and 6.

# Requirements
The “requirements” section is for us to write down the basic criteria we have to meet, to satisfy customer ( professor ), thus resulting a successful project. You also can write down what is allowed too.

This requirements must be determined through asking our customer ( professor ).

1. There are no GUI specification. (i.e. we can design the screen differently if our customer is satisfied with it.)
2. We are making for possibly visually impaired educators
3. We don't care about blind kids
4. We make program to make scenarios and save it
# Project Structure Plan
The “project structure plan” is here to keep track of how the structure of our program will be constructed. The style of our construction will be based on Object Oriented Programming. So we will construct an UML diagram later for visualization.

# Useful Information
The “Useful Information” is for us to share tips and tricks about programming / structuring / documenting our program.

1. [How to make javadoc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx-8BD_Osdw)
2. [GUI maker for eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/)
3. [Markdown editor ( github readme text editor )](https://dillinger.io/)
# Todo List
The “Todo List” is a list of things that we need to accomplish.

1. [ ] Create authoring app
2. [ ] Project requirement document
3. [ ] Testing document
4. [ ] User manual
