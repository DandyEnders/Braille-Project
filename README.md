# Introduction
Purpose of this document is to track our progress on our project.

# Notes to Group Members
- Initially, we were given no requirements, no restrictions, or no useful informations regarding the braille program itself. To construct a successful product, we must conduct researches. 
- This document will be updated constantly.
- Please note that our professor ( customer ) could intentionally tell ambiguous things, so if anything is ambiguous, we must clarify its ambiguity by asking him thoroughly.
- If a topic is a lengthy one to put, please either create a separate google doc and link the document to this document or link directly.  [And here is the instruction how to link your document to this document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DfhXRIQdrxzRiRgt-cYo2Zj-vKfTUzwrMwbMpkG6Hac/edit?usp=sharing)
- Contact infos for our professor are on [this link](https://wiki.eecs.yorku.ca/course_archive/2017-18/W/2311/contact).

# Researches
The “researches” section is for us to write down collection of information related to braille.

Please write down any significant information ( such as how braille works, why are they used, who uses it, how it is used by them) that you found. Also, it would be great if we summarize the information you found for others to know.

Researches can be done through asking the customer ( professor ), searching internet, and possibly, asking a real person - who could be an expert on Braille.

1. [What is Braille?](http://www.afb.org/info/living-with-vision-loss/braille/what-is-braille/123) - “Braille is a system of raised dots that can be read with the fingers by people who are blind or who have low vision … Braille is not a language. Rather, it is a code by which many languages—such as English, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, and dozens of others—may be written and read.”
2. Capital letters are indicated by placing a dot 6 in front of the letter to be capitalized. Two capital signs mean the whole word is capitalized.
3. Punctuation: A “period” is represented with dots 2, 5, and 6. An “exclamation point” is with 2, 3, 5. The “comma” in braille is dot 2, and is used in numbers and with words.
4. [Braille Numbers](http://braillebug.afb.org/braille_deciphering.asp): made using the first ten letters of the alphabet, "a" through "j", and a special number sign, dots 3, 4, 5, and 6.

# Requirements
The “requirements” section is for us to write down the basic criteria we have to meet, to satisfy customer ( professor ), thus resulting a successful project. You also can write down what is allowed too.

This requirements must be determined through asking our customer ( professor ).

1. There are no GUI specification. (i.e. we can design the screen differently if our customer is satisfied with it.)
2. We are making for possibly visually impaired educators
3. We don't care about blind kids
4. We make program to make scenarios and save it
# Project Structure Plan
The “project structure plan” is here to keep track of how the structure of our program will be constructed. The style of our construction will be based on Object Oriented Programming. So we will construct an UML diagram later for visualization.

# Useful Information
The “Useful Information” is for us to share tips and tricks about programming / structuring / documenting our program.

1. [How to make javadoc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx-8BD_Osdw)
2. [GUI maker for eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/)
3. [Markdown editor ( github readme text editor )](https://dillinger.io/)
4. [Markdown tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
