# Introduction
Purpose of this document is to track our progress on our project.

# Notes to Group Members
- Initially, we were given no requirements, no restrictions, or no useful informations regarding the braille program itself. To construct a successful product, we must conduct researches. 
- This document will be updated constantly.
- Please note that our professor ( customer ) could intentionally tell ambiguous things, so if anything is ambiguous, we must clarify its ambiguity by asking him thoroughly.
- If a topic is a lengthy one to put, please either create a separate google doc and link the document to this document or link directly.  [And here is the instruction how to link your document to this document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DfhXRIQdrxzRiRgt-cYo2Zj-vKfTUzwrMwbMpkG6Hac/edit?usp=sharing)
- Contact infos for our professor are on [this link](https://wiki.eecs.yorku.ca/course_archive/2017-18/W/2311/contact).
